# Introduction
For linear models, we compare models obtained through LDA and SVM. LDA minimizes the training error, and SVM minimizes the bolstered resubstitution error.

The linear model here has a fixed complexity. For linear models, we will compare w LDA and w SVM to the underlying Bayesian w using the `cos(w1, w2)` distance, i.e. the angle between the normal directions of the linear hyperplane.
